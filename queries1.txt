-- Question 1

-- A tuple in this relation represents some information of an opening.
-- eco is the standardised code for any given opening,
-- name is the name of the opening moves,
-- win is the probability of winning,
-- draw is the probability of draw,
-- and lose is the probability of losing.
-- All of win, draw, and lose are between 0.0 and 1.0.
-- Order by win descending, and when win ties, order by draw descending.
